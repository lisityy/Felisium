## Plot

The kingdom of cats Felisium (a name derived from the scientific name for domestic cats, Felis catus and also at the beginning of this word FEL) , a prosperous and peaceful land, was suddenly attacked by a group of aliens from a far-off galaxy. The cats were caught off guard, and their homes and territories were destroyed, and many of their feline friends were taken away.

It was then discovered that the aliens were after the cats because they believed that if they ate a cat, they would gain nine lives. The cats were in great danger, and they needed a hero to save them from this extraterrestrial threat.

You play the role of a brave young cat named Pushok, who sets out to rescue his fellow felines and stop the alien invasion. You explore the vast and varied landscapes of the kingdom, from dense forests to treacherous mountains and winding rivers.

Along the way, you encounter a range of enemies, including alien soldiers and strange creatures from other worlds. But with your quick reflexes and sharp claws, you are able to overcome them and continue your journey.
